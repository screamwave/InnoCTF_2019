# Call Me

**Reverse**

Opened in idapro and saw that the main function doesn't produce any flags.

Looked around and found a function `flag()`

In the function I saw that it is looping 36 times and adding array1 to array2.

So I copied those values out and did a similar function as shown below.

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

raw_hex1 = [0x2E,
0x4F,
0x0D,
0x53,
0x10,
0x32,
0x05,
0x39,
0x38,
0x12,
0x62,
0x0A,
0x1F,
0x0B,
0x1D,
0x23,
0x1E,
0x0A,
0x41,
0x18,
0x16,
0x2F,
0x2A,
0x15,
0x2A,
0x65,
0x17,
0x46,
0x1D,
0x60,
0x26,
0x37,
0x2C,
0x05,
0x08,
0x47]

raw_hex2 = [0x1B,
0x1F,
0x61,
0x1C,
0x33,
0x22,
0x41,
0x42,
0x10,
0x5D,
0x15,
0x55,
0x45,
0x26,
0x47,
0x3C,
0x5B,
0x26,
0x34,
0x47,
0x50,
0x02,
0x44,
0x4F,
0x35,
0x08,
0x1C,
0x19,
0x1A,
0x06,
0x0B,
0x2B,
0x37,
0x33,
0x30,
0x36]

part1 = [i for i in raw_hex1]
part2 = [i for i in raw_hex2]

mystr = []

for i in range(len(part1)):
    mystr.append(chr(part1[i]+part2[i]))

print(''.join(mystr))

```

After doing so, I got the flag.

```
InnoCTF{How_d1d_y0u_f1nd_m3_7f1bc88}
